## Analysis Summary
In order to determine how New York Citi Bike data correlates to the potential bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa, an analysis was performed on McDonald's locations for both areas. An analysis of New york was performed using Tableau's mapping tools in order to determine the correlation between McDonald's density and Citi Bike hot spots for bike-share starting locations. Ultimately the following questions wanted to be answered.

    - What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines?
    - Does this affect where people go in the city?

The full analysis that is described below can be found by following the available link:

### Analysis Procedure and Results
The analysis begins with comparing New York Citi Bike sharing data to a side by side view of McDonald's location in New York. Due to the overwhelming amount of starting location data in New York, I decided to filter the data to include the most popular starting locations with more than 8,000 rides in the month of August 2019. From these most popular starting locations, I decided to focus on the top 3 starting locations for New York and find the relativity to McDonald locations. The 4th slide shows that in the top 3 starting locations for Citi Bike fares, there is an associated McDonald's location located nearby to where the bike rides are starting. This is the first important point of the analysis. On the next slide we see that overall, the top starting locations are centralized along McDonald locations.

Transitioning over to Des Moines, Iowa on the next slide, we can notice at first glance that McDonald locations are not as dense as the locations in New York. This could cause some hesitation in convincing the investors that Des Moines will bring a successful amount of business in bike sharing. However, we are confident that the potential for success exists, and we decide to take a closer look on how we can be smart with our initial business plan. On the next slide we focus on the 4 most central McDonald's in Des Moines. Here, we know that these have the highest potential to be successful for bike sharing. Out of these four, we decide that the central two should be the initial locations to launch our bike sharing company. The most two most central McDonald's locations that are closest to each other have the greatest potential after analyzing the data from New York. These two locations will have the most activity and are the two locations we convince the investors to invest in. These two locations will be our main starting locations with smaller check point stations centered around the area. In the future, there is potential to expand our bike sharing locations out as shown in the last slide after reviewing results from the initial launch. The potential for future business should be attractive to our investors as well.
